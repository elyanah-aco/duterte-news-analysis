He adds new strain detected in Sabah, Malaysia.   🔸 Health Sec Francisco Duque says 79 people from the UK has arrived in the Philippines, of which 1 tested positive for COVID-19, 53 tested negative, 23 awaiting results. Duque clarifies the positive case doesn’t mean that the new strain is already present in PH.  🔸 Duque says travel bans should only be done if new coronavirus variant reaches community transmission in the country of origin.  🔸 Duterte removes his mask midway through the meeting, says he's having difficulty speaking with it on.  🔸 Health experts recommend strict implementation of 14-day quarantine period for all travellers coming from any country with reported cases of the new variant.  🔸 President Duterte wants another task force, made up of medical experts, to focus on the new COVID-19 variant.  🔸 Duterte on the Visiting Forces Agreement with US: ""Kung hindi sila maka deliver ng minimum of 20 million vaccines, they better get out. No vaccine no stay here.""  🔸 Duterte extends the travel ban on UK for another 2 weeks past the original expiry on December 31.

Annie Dela Calzada Torres shares his story in a Facebook post on Quarantine Tribute Tips:  “This is Kuya Bon! Nagtitinda sya sa loob ng UP ng taho at soya milk matagal na. Pero dahil walang estudyante, apektado ang kita niya simula pa noong lockdown. So, gusto ko lang sana ihikayat kayo na bumili rin sa kanya. Sobrang masarap po yung gawa niya. Malinis at sariling gawa. Kakabili ko lang po kanina. Everyday, bago po ang products niya.  Php 35.00 po each yung soya milk tapos Php 30.00 po yung especial taho niya with caramelized langka.  Pwede niyo raw po sya i-add sa Facebook niya for orders. Pwede rin po kayo pumunta sa UP CHK. Naandoon po sya ng Tuesday hanggang Friday from 8 am to 11 am.

Do you know the struggles of the deaf people around the world? We are born to all sorts of communication barriers and discrimination all of our lives.  For your information, our natural sign language is not a joke! It is a visual language of the Deaf people, the means of communication of the Deaf community around the world. It serves as bridge between hearing advocates and deaf people!  Your video has reminded me of people who disrespected me with their offensive gestures, mocking our language by gesturing ugly, f**k, p**a i** mo and other sexual innuendos. It has hurt me a lot because I cannot fight back.  How would you feel if others say bad words to you? Angry? Hurt? Disrespected? That is how we feel with your video….we felt disrespected.  Because your fake signing can be bastos...  You work as government official, right? What gives you the right to do this to us?  Are you aware that Filipino sign language is now passing into law and only waiting for the signature of our President Duterte? For all the Filipino Deaf, it’s our hope for equality and equal access when FSL pass into law.  But it is really sad, because Ms. Uson, you are disrespectful to me and our Filipino Deaf people by instructing and encouraging Mr. Olivar to make fun of our language…  We want you to think and understand first how much we feel disrespected. From all people, we should feel respected and protected by people from our government.

Akbayan Senator Risa Hontiveros on Tuesday visited the women and families displaced by the Marawi conflict. In partnership with fellow peace advocate Samira Gutoc-Tomawis, who convenes the Ranao Rescue Team (RRT), the senator distributed relief goods consisting of food, blankets, bath towels and hygiene kits to the Moneerah Integrated School in Iligan, which serves as an evacuation center for hundreds of internally displaced persons.   Hontiveros said that women are one of the most affected by war. She said that many ""women of war"" lost their fathers, husbands and sons. They also become vulnerable to gender-based abuses. The Senator however said that women are also effective peacemakers and rebuilders of communities. She said that the Maranao women will play a central role in rehabilitating Marawi.

I fired so many. - Duterte on the peso's drop: That is the play of monetary... hindi ko na kaya 'yan.  - Duterte: If things get worse in Mindanao, I may declare Martial Law. But as a lawyer, there is no need for it.  - Duterte says Trump – as opposed to ""intellectual"" Obama – is ""tigas tigas"" - Duterte: I like Donald J. Trump. I like Barack Obama too but he's too intellectual - President Duterte on declaring Martial law: I am not up to it, actually.  - Duterte on what taking Fentanyl is for: I had a very bad spill when I was 68. On a pain scale it would be at 6, 7 - Duterte: The ISIS seems to be everywhere. In Samal, there was an explosion, in Midsayap. - Duterte on Nur Misuari: Matanda na nga siya but it will be foolhardy to say that he is a spent thing.  - Duterte: The time to mend sa political scene is quite difficult because of the personalities involved - Duterte says he has background in foreign policy: Talagang foreign service ako. Look at the transcript of my school. - Duterte denies inviting campaign donor Sammy Uy to bilateral talks with Japan PM Shinzō Abe - Ressa: If you were to make a mistake, are the people around you afraid to tell you you were wrong? Duterte: No. - Duterte on his cabinet members: Most of them are my friends. Kilala nila ako, kilala ko sila. Alam nila ugali ko.  - Duterte: On a shoestring budget, I won the Presidency.

And coming to her, he said, ""Hail, full of grace! The Lord is with you.""  But she was greatly troubled at what was said and pondered what sort of greeting this might be.  Then the angel said to her, ""Do not be afraid, Mary, for you have found favor with God.  Behold, you will conceive in your womb and bear a son, and you shall name him Jesus.  He will be great and will be called Son of the Most High, and the Lord God will give him the throne of David his father, and he will rule over the house of Jacob forever, and of his kingdom there will be no end.""  But Mary said to the angel, ""How can this be, since I have no relations with a man?"" And the angel said to her in reply, ""The holy Spirit will come upon you, and the power of the Most High will overshadow you. Therefore the child to be born will be called holy, the Son of God.  And behold, Elizabeth, your relative, has also conceived a son in her old age, and this is the sixth month for her who was called barren; for nothing will be impossible for God.""  Mary said, ""Behold, I am the handmaid of the Lord. May it be done to me according to your word."" Then the angel departed from her.

Both were righteous in the eyes of God, observing all the commandments and ordinances of the Lord blamelessly.  But they had no child, because Elizabeth was barren and both were advanced in years. Once when he was serving as priest in his division's turn before God,  according to the practice of the priestly service, he was chosen by lot to enter the sanctuary of the Lord to burn incense.  Then, when the whole assembly of the people was praying outside at the hour of the incense offering,  the angel of the Lord appeared to him, standing at the right of the altar of incense.  Zechariah was troubled by what he saw, and fear came upon him.  But the angel said to him, ""Do not be afraid, Zechariah, because your prayer has been heard. Your wife Elizabeth will bear you a son, and you shall name him John. And you will have joy and gladness, and many will rejoice at his birth,  for he will be great in the sight of (the) Lord. He will drink neither wine nor strong drink. He will be filled with the holy Spirit even from his mother's womb, and he will turn many of the children of Israel to the Lord their God.  He will go before him in the spirit and power of Elijah to turn the hearts of fathers toward children and the disobedient to the understanding of the righteous, to prepare a people fit for the Lord."" Then Zechariah said to the angel, ""How shall I know this? For I am an old man, and my wife is advanced in years.""  And the angel said to him in reply, ""I am Gabriel, who stand before God. I was sent to speak to you and to announce to you this good news. But now you will be speechless and unable to talk until the day these things take place, because you did not believe my words, which will be fulfilled at their proper time."" Meanwhile the people were waiting for Zechariah and were amazed that he stayed so long in the sanctuary.  But when he came out, he was unable to speak to them, and they realized that he had seen a vision in the sanctuary. He was gesturing to them but remained mute.  Then, when his days of ministry were completed, he went home.  After this time his wife Elizabeth conceived, and she went into seclusion for five months, saying,  So has the Lord done for me at a time when he has seen fit to take away my disgrace before others.
